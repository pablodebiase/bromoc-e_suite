-Include from CHARMM info to ptype and etype 
-Make charmm bonded routine for each particle
-Reorganized arrays for doing the previous point
-find out why it was using many more rndm function in new bromoc than in old bromoc
-try to minimize the use of count
-Add internal non-bonded interactions for charmm particles
-Fix nonbonded combination rules from bromocea. Add eps and sigma to element types. Ignore eps/sigma-1,4
-count particles only of kind 3
-count ions only of kind 3
--Add read coor from crd
--Add feature to read multiple repeated prm sections
